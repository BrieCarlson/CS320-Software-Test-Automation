How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
- Ensuring my code was functional and secure involved more testing than I had ever done in a previous class or project. I set up tests and ran them, checking results and coverage until it was sufficient. I corresponded my tests to sections of code to check their functionality and ensure nothing is missed. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
- To interpret user needs I begin by reading them to make a plan for how I will incorporate it into the program. With the constraints on input for size and not accepting null input it was easy to factor in these limitations by implementing if statements to check for the appropriate input. Then when testing these inputs I ensure the proper response when giving valid vs invalid input. 

How do I approach designing software?
- When I begin a project I look at the requirements and make a list for what needs to be in the system, from there I can begin sorting out the sections of code and how they should function. I focus on the desired result first, then focus on the code to get it there, then check that each section works as intended. Once it's done I go back and look for ways to refine it by simplifying messy code where applicable and looking for better ways I could improve the flow.
